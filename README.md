# OCR Model

## Project Overview

This project involves creating an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model to automatically read and interpret text from images. The objective is to facilitate the extraction of textual information from various types of documents and images, making it easier to digitize and process large volumes of text data efficiently.

## Project Instructions

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Automate text extraction** from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OCR techniques.
2. **Training**: Train the model with different approaches to improve accuracy.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Calculate the **accuracy**.
   - Calculate **precision and recall** for text recognition.

## Usage

1. Open the `OCR_Model.ipynb` notebook.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook.
3. The notebook contains the necessary code cells to run the entire pipeline, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
4. Each line is commented to explain its purpose and functionality.
